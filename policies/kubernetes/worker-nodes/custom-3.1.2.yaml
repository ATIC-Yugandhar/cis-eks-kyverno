      \ ownership for proper security boundaries.\n\nSINGLE-TOOL APPROACH: This control\
      \ uses custom CIS scanner results combined with Kyverno validation.\n\nCUSTOM\
      \ CIS SCANNER: File ownership validation is performed by our custom CIS scanner\
      \ DaemonSet that runs on each node to check:\n- /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf\
      \ ownership (should be root:root)\n- /etc/kubernetes/worker-kubeconfig ownership\n\
      - Other kubeconfig files used by kubelet\n- Results are output as JSON to ConfigMaps\n\
      \nKYVERNO VALIDATION: This policy validates both:\n- Custom CIS scanner results\
      \ from ConfigMaps for actual file ownership\n- Pod security contexts and ServiceAccount\
      \ configurations for complementary API-level controls\n"
