    policies.kyverno.io/description: "CIS 3.1.2: Ensure that the kubelet kubeconfig\
      \ file ownership is set to root:root.\n\nIMPORTANT: This control requires direct\
      \ access to worker node file systems to validate kubelet \nkubeconfig file ownership.\
      \ Kyverno cannot directly access node file systems or validate file ownership.\n\
      \nKUBE-BENCH INTEGRATION REQUIRED: This control must be validated using kube-bench,\
      \ which runs \nprivileged pods on worker nodes to access and validate file ownership\
      \ on kubelet kubeconfig files.\n\nThis policy validates Pod security contexts\
      \ and root user restrictions, but the primary \nvalidation of actual file ownership\
      \ occurs through kube-bench node-level scanning.\n"
