      CIS 3.1.2: Ensure that the kubelet kubeconfig file ownership is set to root:root.
      
      IMPORTANT: This control requires direct access to worker node file systems to validate kubelet 
      kubeconfig file ownership. Kyverno cannot directly access node file systems or validate file ownership.
      
      KUBE-BENCH INTEGRATION REQUIRED: This control must be validated using kube-bench, which runs 
      privileged pods on worker nodes to access and validate file ownership on kubelet kubeconfig files.
      
      This policy validates Pod security contexts and root user restrictions, but the primary 
      validation of actual file ownership occurs through kube-bench node-level scanning.
