      CIS 3.2.3: Ensure that the --client-ca-file argument is set as appropriate.
      
      IMPORTANT: This control requires direct access to worker node kubelet configuration files 
      to validate the client CA file setting. Kyverno cannot directly access node configuration files.
      
      KUBE-BENCH INTEGRATION REQUIRED: This control must be validated using kube-bench, which runs 
      privileged pods on worker nodes to access and validate kubelet configuration files.
      
      This policy validates Pod-level TLS and certificate configurations that relate to client CA usage, 
      but the primary validation of kubelet client CA file settings occurs through kube-bench.
