# Compliance Reports

This folder contains the results of automated Kyverno JSON policy scans against Terraform plans for both compliant and noncompliant EKS clusters.

- Reports are generated by the `scripts/test-terraform-cis-policies.sh` automation script.
- Each report shows which CIS controls (enforced by Kyverno JSON policies) are passed or failed at the Terraform plan stage.

## Files
- `kyverno-tfplan-report.yaml`: Results for the compliant stack (should pass all enforceable policies).
- `kyverno-tfplan-noncompliant-report.yaml`: Results for the noncompliant stack (should fail relevant policies).
- Additional files may include test outputs for individual policies.

## How to Interpret
- Each policy result is listed as PASSED or FAILED, with details for any failures.
- Use these reports to audit compliance and demonstrate policy enforcement at the plan level.

## References
- See `scripts/README.md` for automation details.
- See `kyverno-policies/terraform/README.md` for policy documentation.
